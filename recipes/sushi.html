    <h2> Preparation </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Rinse the sushi rice to the point water comes out clear of it.
        You can always use a strainer for it, and warm water should do the trick faster than cold water.
      </li>
      <li>
        Pour the rice on a pot and pour water on it untill both have the same level.
        Heat the pot on low fire.
      </li>
      <li>
        When the water starts boiling, add the vinager to the rice and let it cook until no water is visible from the surface.
        Turn off the fire and let the rice cool for five minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Place a nori sheet on the sushi mat, and cover it with a uniform layer of rice, about 5mm tall.
      </li>
      <li> Optional: add the sesame to the rice.</li>
      <li>
        Add two or three items from the <a href="#filling">filling list</a> horizontally at the top of the rice.
      </li>
      <li>
        Roll the nori from top to bottom with the rice and its contents.
      </li>
      <li>
        With the given portions, you should be able to complete three rolls.
      </li>
      <li>
        To cut the sushi into slices, soak a knife in water and cut one slice.
        Soak it each time you want a new slice so it does not jam with the rice.
        A nori sheet is usually around ten slices long.
      </li>
    </ol>
